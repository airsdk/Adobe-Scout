# Adobe Scout

HARMAN have access to the Adobe Scout source code now and have made some changes in the Android mobile configuration app, to cope with Android 12 file-sharing restrictions.

There are some feature requests and bugs in Scout that have been mentioned to us, so this repository is created as a place for issues to be raised - either as bug reports, or as enhancement requests.

Our releases will be made available via the official AIR SDK website (we'll provide direct links here perhaps), and for the Android configuration app you can find this on the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.harman.air.scout.companion
